# GPA Calculator

A high-performance, cross-platform mobile application designed to help students calculate, track, and manage their academic progress with mathematical accuracy. Built with **TypeScript** and **React Native**, this tool moves beyond simple arithmetic to provide a customizable environment that adapts to various university grading standards.

## Overview
GPA Calculator offers a seamless user experience for academic tracking. By leveraging local persistence and a modular component architecture, the app allows users to define their own grading scales, store calculation history locally, and manage multiple course loads simultaneously. It is optimized for both performance and clarity, ensuring students can focus on their results rather than the math behind them.

## Features
*   **Dynamic Course Management**: Add or remove courses on the fly with a responsive interface.
*   **Customizable Grade Scales**: Fully editable grading system (A-F) with adjustable point values to match specific institutional requirements.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Automatic saving of GPA history and settings using `AsyncStorage`, ensuring data remains available across sessions.
*   **Real-time Validation**: Intelligent input validation that prevents calculation errors from empty fields or invalid credit units.
*   **Modern UI/UX**: Smooth animations powered by `react-native-reanimated` and a clean, accessible design.

## Usage Guide

### Calculating GPA
Navigate to the **Calculator** tab. Enter a name for your calculation (e.g., "Year 1 - Semester 1"). Add your courses by providing the course name, credit units, and the grade achieved. Tap "Calculate GPA" to see your result instantly.

### Customizing Grades
Different schools use different scales (e.g., 4.0 vs 5.0). Go to the **Settings** tab to edit the point values for each grade. You can also reset these to the default 5.0 scale at any time.

### Reviewing History
Every successful calculation is automatically logged. Switch to the **History** tab to see your previous performance records, including the date of calculation and the specific GPA achieved.
